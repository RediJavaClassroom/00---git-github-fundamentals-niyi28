# About Niyi
## Introduction
I am Oyeniyi Olaniyi from Nigeria aka omo Naija haha. I like to laugh alot and sometimes I sleep on my chair.

## My Professional interest
I like learning and sometimes my learning directional can be so disorganised, however, I am hopeful I can find a career path in Java

## Hobbies
You must have guessed sleeping hahaha, actually its more involuntarily than voluntary most times. I like video games but im not a vivid gamer. What I can say
im sure I like doing is imagining, getting lost in my thoughts. I sometimes loose concentration during discussions because of this hahaha

## My ReDI target
I hope to learn more about coding than the usual console usage. Also use more APIs and bi-lateral linkage with databases.

## Current Task
Currently, I dont have a task or partner in the advanced Java. However, im looking forward to the URL shortner exercise.
